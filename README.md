# HR-Attrition-Analysis-Dashboard
## 📌 Project Overview

This project showcases a comprehensive HR Attrition Analysis Dashboard built using Power BI. The dashboard is designed to help Human Resources teams identify and understand trends and patterns in employee attrition across various dimensions such as **age**, **experience**, and **job roles**.
The goal of this analysis is to uncover insights that can support data-driven decisions around **employee retention**, **workforce planning**, and **organizational development**. The dashboard is fully interactive, allowing users to filter data by different criteria such as department, gender, education level, and marital status to reveal granular patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed.
By visualizing key metrics like attrition rate, average age, tenure, and job role distribution, the dashboard allows stakeholders to take proactive steps in improving employee satisfaction and reducing turnover.
